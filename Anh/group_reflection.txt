When we initially started forming a group, I think our group was going to be very thoughtful and carefully plan out like most of the groups on other projects that I have been to in the past. However, after the first three days or so it just became a roller coaster of emotions, it started out really great and then remained surprisingly quiet even after a new group member joined in. Two weeks has passed, there still no communication between group members which is very worrisome, no one talks about anything or building up any structure for the assignment, beside a team member notify that a google doc file was made for everyone to put in their individual work. Week 8 rolled over, all of the team members agree on to meet up and start working on group work. And to my surprise, everyone is super active and really open which is very odd for them to be so quiet at first. Everything went really smoothly during our session, we got everything done and settle up with the framework for the whole assignment really quickly using google doc and GitHub functions. After the meeting everyone started to become really active, their frequency of progress summation is extremely high, pretty much everyone reported almost everything about what they were doing, what was the troubles, etc. With this team, I think we achieve great result with. However, one thing that should really be improve is the whole group's initial communication since it could set the mood for everyone to start focusing on the work and help them thrive for better result. With that said, everyone has done a superb job on the workflow and communicating with each other. Because of this team, I've learned that not every person, every group in this case have the same style of laying out, preplanning first and then start working. Every person, every team have their own strong and week points, all we have got to do is trusting each other on their own capability.
