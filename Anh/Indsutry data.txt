hour glass opinion
It doesn’t change much in my very own opinion since testing isn’t very popular since almost anyone could do it but effectiveness may vary. And since every piece of tech that came out, you will need someone to test it out and report what they have found to effectively minimize the problem and potentials of failures and since figuring out how things works is a part of my hobby so the ranking doesn’t affect much about how I see being a tester is not relevant.
