Group Reflection:
In my point of view, the things that went well in our group that is everyone has a high sense of responsibility and the overall skills of all members are good. Furthermore, everyone is so friendly and supportive when there is a problem. If I do not sure about something, I know that I just need to ask and they are more than willing to show me the way. In the end, we are able to understand the problem that our group had, and everyone is striving to solve that problem. The thing that needs to improve is our communication and task-and-role dividing skills. Communication is key to bring every member to work together and we have to have a specific role for each member and have a detailed plan to follow up with our tasks being divided well for everyone. Our team also needs to figure a way to improve the team atmosphere to be more interesting and safe (no-judging environment) to let every member is more engaging and to be more creative when solving a problem. The first thing that surprised me the most is that our work progress after the first meeting was incredible. The atmosphere of the group was improved and everyone was more engaged in the group work.
The second thing is that every member is friendly to receive comments and discuss it thoroughly to improve the quality of the group work. From this experience, I learned that everyone should actively try to understand others and find the most suitable way to work with the group. Furthermore, I also learned that people are just imperfect, everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. However, we should help each other to improve our weaknesses step by step and also continue to develop our strengths to a new level. Finally, I believe that everyone should try their best to step out of their comfort zone, be more open, and believe in others.
