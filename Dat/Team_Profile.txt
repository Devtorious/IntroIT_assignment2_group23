How these test results may be helpful to the group: I am very open-minded, which means that I can be a good listener and embrace all the ideas coming from any teammates in the group; but I also need some private spaces to refresh both inner and outer of my body. I am also very optimistic, and I believe that is a virtue that can cheer up my teammates when they hit a rock-bottom. I have to admit I have not become talented yet in this IT field, but I am a type of person who is willing to learn everything to achieve my goals, which hopefully can inspire others to work together and come through obstacles. However, every coin has two sides, I can really easily get burned out and my idealistics vision might cause conflicts with others.
