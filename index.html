            <p>Trung</p> 
              <ul>
                <li>Myers-Briggs test(MBTI): ISFJ-T / Defender</li>
                <li>Learning style: visual learner</li>
                <li>Big Five personality test: Openness 46%, Conscientiousness 48%, Extraversion 40%, Agreeable 60%, Neuroticism 67%</li>
              </ul>
              <p>How does this affect my position in a team: i'm a talktive and quite helpful person (because i'm willing to and got the skill to help) in a group. I'm also opened to critism and is willing to change as long as it's valid point. However, i'm not suit to be a leader because i can't be strict nor i can motivate others effectively (given my laid back mood). But as a fellow teamate, i believe that i can provide a good support for everyone when they need help, whether it's about morale support or technical issue. </p>
            <p>Anh</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Myers-Briggs test(MBTI): INFP-A / INFP-T</li>
                <li>Learning style: auditory and visual learner</li>
                <li>Big Five personality test: Openness 56%, Conscientiousness 35%, Extraversion 35%, Agreeable 60%, Neuroticism 77%</li>
              </ul>
	            <p>These information meaning that I am not very talkative but is someone who is willing to listen and analyze the value of others ideas. I also can be so focused on what I’m doing, that I forget about what is around me. My personality can create a lot of problems and misunderstanding between members and it can also negatively affect the flow of the whole group.</p>
            <p>Dat</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Myers-Briggs test: INFJ - Advocate</li>
                <li>Learning Style test: Tactile Learner</li>
                <li>Big Five Personality test: Openness - 83/100, Conscientiousness - 69/100, Extraversion - 73/100, Agreeableness - 71/100, and Neuroticism - 44/100</li>
              </ul>
              <p>How these test results may be helpful to the group: I am very open-minded, which means that I can be a good listener and embrace all the ideas coming from any teammates in the group; but I also need some private spaces to refresh both inner and outer of my body. I am also very optimistic, and I believe that is a virtue that can cheer up my teammates when they hit a rock-bottom. I have to admit I have not become talented yet in this IT field, but I am a type of person who is willing to learn everything to achieve my goals, which hopefully can inspire others to work together and come through obstacles. However, every coin has two sides, I can really easily get burned out and my idealistics vision might cause conflicts with others. </p>
            <p>Minh</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Myers-Briggs test(MBTI): ISTJ</li>
                <li>Learning style test: Visual</li>
                <li>Big five personality test: Neuroticism: 70 (low), Extraversion: 66 (low), Openness to experience: 83 (high), Agreeableness: 80 (high), Conscientiousness: 75 (high)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The meaning of these results: I am open to co-operation, can work fairly well with others, so normal teamwork is no problem. I also take responsibility for my work and will devote time and effort towards the final goal. The way I think is based on sets of rules and observations (logical). One important note is that I may get tense during stressful situations. This may lead to a tense environment between the member's interactions and myself. I also lack the passion required for abstract goals. These problems can negatively affect the group work flow. </p>

          <h3 style="color: red;">Ideal Jobs</h3>
            <p>Group Work</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Trung: Fullstack web developer</li>
                <li>Minh: Fullstack web developer</li>
                <li>Quang Anh: Test analyst</li>
                <li>Dat: Senior backend web developer</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Common elements: As we can see, 3 of our members wish to have a job in the web development sector (2 fullstack developers, 1 backend developer) and only Quang Anh wants to be a test analyst. Fullstack developers (Minh and Trung) are required to be proficient in both frontend and backend development, while backend developers (Dat) are more specialized in the backend tasks, which means that these jobs are similar to a large extent.</p>
              <p>Differences: On the other hand, Quang Anh’s role as a Test Analyst differs greatly from the that of the other team members due to the nature of the role, which is to run through the process of how they function and figure out ways to help optimize the front end’s solution. The role of a tester is more like a delivery guy, they essentially have to get the source from the front end and then run in different scenarios, report and then transfer them to the back end to figure out a more in depth solution and repeat until everything is finalized. While Fullstack developers can handle both front end and back end, it’s possible that someone who devotes all his time to a single one likes backend developer may have more insight to add to the project. That’s why it’s not a redundant job.</p>
              <p>Career path: Our career paths are all similar to most degrees, such as we will all accumulate as much knowledge of the subjects as possible and then apply for potential companies that are suitable for our expertises.</p>
