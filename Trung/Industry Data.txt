Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?

No, it’s not. IMO, ranking job titles based on popularity kind of meaningless, at least for me. It doesn’t show me which job has the highest income, brightest future or hardest time. It’s just based on the population. After some research, Full-stack developer is still my ideal job at the moment because of the income and challenges it brings.
