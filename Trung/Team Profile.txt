How does this affect my position in a team: i'm a talktive and quite helpful person (because i'm willing to and got the skill to help) in a group. I'm also opened to critism and is willing to change as long as it's valid point. However, i'm not suit to be a leader because i can't be strict nor i can motivate others effectively (given my laid back mood). But as a fellow teamate, i believe that i can provide a good support for everyone when they need help, whether it's about morale support or technical issue.
