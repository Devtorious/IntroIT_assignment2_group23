In the first week, after our group was form, we didn't really do anything for a week or 2 except for creating a GitHub repository in around that time.
During the second week(week7) one of our member created a draft file on google doc for everyone to gather ideas and plan out everything, he made a really amazing layout for everyone to follow. However no body really add anything in it yet for that entire week which was pretty worrisome.
Week 8 came, we had a meeting between the group members to work on the draft and figuring out how grouping works on GitHub. At the end of that session, we manage to complete most or all of the required group work in that day and was able to outline everything that everyone have to do.
Later on, the group activities are somewhat slow, we lacked a lot of communication and also due to my personality I couldn't jump in the group's occasional discussion there for could lead to other's member misunderstandings. And about my part in the group, I would say got a bunch of things down and ready already but I'm just not very confident in whether i should submit it in for the group's page or not since I feared that would ruin the guy's who work on the site's plan.
Also I do think that since we lack a leader it is pretty hard to make people more active about the group's activities which could be the reason why the group's atmosphere was so dull and not very interesting.
However everyone in the group's knows their part, what to do and i do think that in later assignment we could manage to tackle them through.
